# Litter Lens (formerly Trash Talk) (HT6)

How many times have you been walking around the city and seen trash on the ground, sometimes just centimetres away from a trash can? It can be very frustrating to see people who either have no regard for littering, or just have horrible aim. This is what inspired us to create TrashTalk: trash talk for your trash shots.

## Getting Started (MVP)
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install node.js, express.js, opencv, pygame, pyserial, serial and requests if you don't have it installed yet.
3. Make sure you have 2 webcams and an Arduino Uno. Both webcams should be facing the same direction at different sides of the can. The Arduino should be between both cameras but should still be on the rim.
4. Connect them via a USB splitter and connect it to your computer.
5. Run node server.js and python runner.py.
